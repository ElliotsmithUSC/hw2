I had issues with pushing to github through codio I believe it had to deal with the branching and had an incident where all of my code got deleted and had to regain it through the code playback feature of codio. This caused some weird errors that I had to work around. For example in the addtocart function of mydatastore the only way i could change the value of hitnum was by setting another int to hitnum which then allowed hitnum to be modified. There were a variety of quirks like this and I am now enlightened of the downsides of codio.
